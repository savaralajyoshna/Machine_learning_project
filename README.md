# Text Classification with scikit-learn

This repository demonstrates text classification using scikit-learn, focusing on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

## Overview

The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, evenly distributed across 20 different newsgroups. It's a popular dataset for text classification and clustering tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy

### Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn numpy
   ```

### Usage

- The core code is in the Jupyter Notebook `News Topic Classification using Machine Learning Techniques.ipynb`. You can run it step by step to understand text classification with scikit-learn.

- The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. You can modify and extend it for your specific text classification tasks.

## Results

- Classified the articles with 91.3% accuracy.
